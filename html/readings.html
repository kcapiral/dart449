					As We May Think / How the Atom Bomb Helped Give Birth to the Internet
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				In both readings, the topic of the development in technology and human knowledge are discussed by examples of research, concepts and preliminary products. Individuals who have contributed in the advancement of technology are considered to be scientists. They are the ones who have analyzed a problem, conducted a research and proposed a solution based on their findings. These scientists who have made progress in technological history were often dismissed during their time but were later on recognized for their exemplary works. For example, Paul Baran, a researcher at Research and Development had found faults within the communication network during the political events of the 1950's. Baran thus decided to find a way to improve the communication network by coming up with a newer, efficient and cost saving solution. He had a proposed something so different from the norm, which was the use of analog communication, that his idea was dismissed. Although this was an opportunity for advanced technology, it was too new for the era and the world just couldn't handle the change at that time. This becomes the issue in the development of technology. As it was stated in "As We May Think", the development of concepts was not possible due to the material constraint of that time. In the case of "How the Atomic Bomb Helped Give Birth to the Internet", proposing a new idea was a simple matter of timing and support from an environment such during the establishment of RAND. Humans have the capacity to manifest ideas and concepts that can be far out of reach but if we were to be able to continue researching, exploring and experiment with these notions the advances of technology would skyrocket. It's just a matter of accepting and properly implementing them in a way that would help humanity in a positive way.

					Wizards, Bureaucrats, Warriors and Hackers: Writing the History of the Internet
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				It's funny to think that many of us are so connected to the internet and it has become a part of our identity and what we use it for is actually not what is what made for originally. I must admit, I am one of those people who was oblivious or didn't even think about how the internet even came to be.

				It's hard to believe that a tool we use to watch Youtube, post selfies on Instagram or read the TIL thread on Reddit was meant for researchers, scientists, government officials and military. I can't imagine them doing what the millennials are doing right now. The internet was formerly known by those highly powerful and intellectual as ARPANET. It was a big project that needed big funds and the ARPANET received them from powerful individuals who were involved in politics and military. The scientists intended it to link computers at scientific laboratories to share data amongst one another, however, those with military power intended it to not be shared amongst the public. Both parties had different purposes, but the purpose for the greater good prevailed and thus is the reason why the internet can be used by anyone. The internet is the philosophy of sharing, openness, decentralization and has the capacity to improve the world.

				Although we don't want to associate such a great tool with war, the computerization of society we live in as Frank Rose explains, as essentially been a side effect of the computerization of war. In the end, the advances of technology were thanks to the collaboration of the not so average peoples, the intellectual and the powerful. Even if the internet was kept from the public, it's something so powerful that it would have been leaked for the purpose of advancing and sharing human knowledge.

					The Virtual Revolution: The Great Leveling
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				The creation of the internet allows the public to share information anytime and anywhere. However, this notion challenges authorities because there is no control over sharing content. The internet was meant for everyone to have equal access, equal power and an equal voice but this defies the laws of human primordial instincts which is to control and to govern. But because of widespread use of the internet, the internet will never be under the influence of a monopolistic figure but more so, be given its power to the people. This led to the issue of authority and copyright which became stuck on my mind throughout the video. I believe that sharing content for free is the best way for people to learn and understand but I also believe that the time and effort an individual or group (let's say rather than company) should also be credited either by pay or by direct promotion or recognition.
				
				Sharing content for free is great as long as the individual or group was acknowledged and clearly stated. However, it would also be great if people are reasonably and properly rewarded for their time and efforts they put into their service or product, but it wouldn't be just if they start asking for a price that profits them at an abnormally wide scale. In that case, that is when people cross into the line of being business driven and monopolization rather than providing an aid for the better of human society. By the end of the video, the reporter had made me realize that the internet is a tool that society is still adapting to and reorganizing economic and societal infrastructures. The temporary solution available to us to make both the individuals who support freedom of sharing vs. authoritative solutions is to have in mind the responsibility of what gets put up on the internet while allowing opportunities for other to become innovative.

					Is Google Making Us Stupid?
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				The internet is potentially a powerful tool to mankind depending on the user. In the case of reading, the internet provides quick and easily accessible information. This however, develops a short attention span because since everything is readily available, the user can become quite overwhelmed with all the information and therefore needs to skim through things to get to everything. With access to literally information worldwide, people don’t have the time to read things properly and must retain as much information and move on to the next data as quickly as possible. But the Internet does allow for opportunities for lengthy research that may or may not be available due to location, security or scarcity reasons. Academic articles, journals and papers are published online thanks to the researchers who are open to share their works (as long as they are credited). These academic resources can’t be summarized as they provide full details of the research and is a tool that simply can’t be skimmed through. The Internet also provides other research methods such as imagery, videos and podcasts that are more suitable to be locate in the online environment. Although we live in a fast world which the Internet solves the need for efficiency and immediacy, like the article states, it weakens the capacity for deep reading and making rich mental connections because we aren’t fully engaged, immersed and stimulated through the act of skimming. But in all honesty, it really depends on the individual in their ability and attitude in absorbing and processing information. To prevent the web of reprogramming us, we have to be aware of its impact and its influences in our daily performance whether it’d be at school, at work, or at home. The Internet is a great tool as long as we don’t let it take over our brains and instead work with it.

					Databuse: Digital Privacy and the Mosaic
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				In my experience, I have been a victim of database but it hasn’t harmed me in any way. The information the mined from my profile isn’t a concern for me (yet) but has so far, been a help. The platforms that I’m aware of that uses my preferences include Facebook and Instagram but for all the advertisements related to my preferences, they actually intrigued me to go check out whatever they were showing me. Which probably isn’t a good thing that I get caught in their trap, but for example, when I did some research for the best UI/UX applications, I had Facebook recommendations which I thought were useful. I think it’s especially helpful when I search for a new app game to play on my phone and I don’t really know what I’m looking for but when I see recommendations for me, it makes it a lot easier for me and I might find a game that I’ll like that I might have not thought about ever playing. In a way, database doesn’t really bother me because for now it just gives me opportunities and ideas. The thought of being stalked and taken information from my profile does sound creepy and invasive but that’s why I don’t think so much about it. I think that some (not all) dataminers want to help the user, rather than sabotage their lives. It can be done with permission though because it shows an agreement of respect between the user and the platform. To an extent, users should be aware of the platforms they use and if privacy is a big concern, to know what they should or not put in about themselves. We can’t fully blame technology for invading our privacy. Knowing technology, how to use it and how it works can help prevent unacknowledged database.

					Net Neutrality:  A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-offs
				</div>
			</section>
			<section class="article">
				I strongly believe in the idea of net neutrality because it stays true the original purpose of the internet, which was a decentralized network. If we remove net neutrality, we are letting corporations take over something that was given to the public as an open source and letting them take power and control. Internet service providers are obviously doing this for one purpose and that is to make money! The public was given the gift of a decentralized network and now big players want to take that away and make it their own “property” by placing limitations on delivery and viewing/blocking of content. The internet is such a powerful tool that if net neutrality is taken away, then that powerful tool becomes a “weapon” for the ones that are taking it away. In my opinion, the only people who gain from this are the capitalist and in doing so, it’s just building up the world of money and greed (capitalism). This topic really angers me because net neutrality in a sense is freedom. Removing it is taking away our freedom and given restrictions unless we pay for additional services. The world is already struggling to pay internet bills because it’s expensive enough. Imagine if you had basic internet and it’s slow enough in general browsing and downloading but then the service providers decide to block or slow down your access even more because that website has so much traffic and the only way to get back your “normal” speed is to pay an additional fee just so that you can properly and sanely browse through. It doesn’t make any sense. This way, whatever internet plan we’re already paying for, we’d have to pay additional prices just so that we can get better access. Like, we’re already paying for what we can afford and what will make us happy, so taking net neutrality away is like making us pay more for happiness that we had during net neutrality…
